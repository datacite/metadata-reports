# DataCite metadata reports - preprints

DataCite recently examined the DOIs that have been created for software (see https://doi.org/10.5438/1nmy-9902)

I have used the [R code provided](https://github.com/datacite/metadata-reports/blob/master/software/index.md) to examine the DOIs that have been created for **preprints**

Code and results here: [index.md](https://github.com/bmkramer/datacite-metadata-reports/blob/master/preprints/index.md)
